            <p>
                My name is Steven Mann, an aspiring web devloper in Houston, TX. I graduated from St. Edwards University
                with a bachelor's degree in Business Administrartion. Since then I have spent my time working in Houston
                across various fields before ultimately deciding to swich carrer paths. Currently, I am attending a
                coding bootcamp through the University of Texas. I hope that by the completion of this bootcamp to
                become a better web developer and ready to launch my new career.

                <br />
                <br />

                When I am not working on my career, I enjoy writing, recording and perfoming music across the state of
                Texas.
                I perform in several local bands and enjoy playing genres from country and americana to blues and rock.
                I
                have opened
                for acts such as Kyle Hollingsworth, Dumpstafunk, Naughty Professor, George Porter Jr., Organ Freeman
                and
                The Texas Gentlemen.
                I also enjoy outdoor activities such as biking, fishing, and camping. On my most recent camping trip, I
                traveled to Lost Maples
                just outside of San Antonio, spending four days and nights
                in the remote Texas hillcountry.
